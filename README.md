# scalascripts
collecting data from third party companies, placeiq and factual.
the schema of the data is "device date daytype name city state os"
and there is another "theaters" data, where there is some information about theaters in the cities.
the script is to find out number of the overlaped device ids between data from placeiq and data from factual. And the device ids are from the 
same theaters, that's where we used the "theaters" data.
